- [Google Place API] - The Google Place API in Google Maps Platform pulls data from a location or an address, returning information and properties about that location or address. For example, you can pull a restaurant's name, address, phone number, rating, and reviews. You can also explore and search for places around a location. The Google Place API can be used in many different applications, for example map applications, tourism applications and more.

- [Google Directions API] - The Google Directions API in Google Maps Platform provides directions from a starting point to a destination point. The API gives detailed information on how to make the journey and evaluates all options (such as car, walking, bus, train). The API also generates maps with detailed information, including route suggestions and alternative routes.
